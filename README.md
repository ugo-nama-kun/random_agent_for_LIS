# random_agent_for_LIS
This is the random agent for LIS. This agent doesn't load and use caffe pre-trained model, and keeps taking random actions.

To run this code, you need to just typing

```
python server.py
```

in your random_agent_for_LIS directory (as is the original LIS sample-agent ;-) ).
